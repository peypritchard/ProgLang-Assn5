 swipl -s [cracker].

TO RUN: (after loading to swipl)
 ?- go.


TO PLAY PEG GAME:
 Get in your car and drive to 4008 I-35, Denton, TX 76207.
 To avoid getting booted from the location before you  finish your
 peg game, you may want to order something and tip your waiter.
 I've heard good things about their mashed potatoes.
